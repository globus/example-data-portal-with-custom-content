# Custom Content

This is an example of a serverless portal with custom content.

Learn more about this example in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/globus/example-data-portal-with-custom-content).

# Hosting Assets

Assets can be hosted alongside your content by adding a `/content/assets/` directory in your repository. Files included in the `assets` directory will be hosted at the root of your deployed application â€“ **keep this in mind when naming paths!**

You can then reference your assets using your full portal origin, or using a relative path, e.g. `![](/creating-custom-content.gif)`.

![](/creating-custom-content.gif)
